Requirements:
- Python 2.4 or higher
- PyQt4 (thus also Qt4)
- python-pysqlite2 for softwareDB tool
- openMSX, preferably a recent version from Subversion (post 0.6.1)

Or you can get openMSX and Catapult from Subversion (SVN), that way you will
be able to follow development:
  svn co https://openmsx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openmsx/openmsx/trunk openmsx
  svn co https://openmsx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openmsx/catapult/trunk catapult

For the moment, you have to set some hardcoded paths to values
corresponding to your system. You can find these in "custom.py".

Then to start Catapult, just run "make".
