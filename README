openMSX Catapult
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the new openMSX Catapult, an external GUI for openMSX.

Requirements:
- Python 2.5 or higher
- PyQt4 (thus also Qt4)
- python-pysqlite2 for softwareDB tool
- openMSX, preferably a recent version from Subversion (post 0.6.3)

Download links:

Qt4: (pick one of the Open Source Editions)
  http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/downloads
PyQt4: (compilation requires SIP to be installed as well)
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/download.php
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php
openMSX:
  http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/temp/openmsx-SVN-snapshot.tar.gz
Catapult:
  http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/temp/catapult-SVN-snapshot.tar.gz

Or you can get openMSX and Catapult from Subversion (SVN), that way you will
be able to follow development:
  svn co https://openmsx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openmsx/openmsx/trunk openmsx
  svn co https://openmsx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openmsx/catapult/trunk catapult

For the moment, you have to set some hardcoded paths to values
corresponding to your system. You can find these in "custom.py".

If your system's default Python version is not Python 2.5, then change the line
"python catapult.py" in the Makefile into "python2.5 catapult.py".

Then to start Catapult, just run "make".

If you have problems like: KeyError: 'system/executable', you're hitting a
small problem in this Catapult that has not been resolved yet. To fix it in
*nix systems, make a file ~/.config/openMSX/Catapult.conf and put in it:
[system]
executable=/path/to/your/openmsx/executable

Win32/MSYS  Section

I assume you have Python 2.5 and PyQt installed in C:\Python25\  if this is not the case adjust your paths accordingly.

Make sure the python.exe file is accessible through your path (set path in my computer->Advanced->Environment Variables->(go to lower window and add ;C:\Python25 to the path.

- Create a file in your Python root folder called pyuic
- Put the following line into the code:
  /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/uic/pyuic.py ${1+"$@"}
- chmod this file so it's executable from within msys: chmod +x /c/Python25/pyuic
- if you are missing MSVCP71.DLL please download this file from
  http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp71
  and put it in your c:\windows\system32\ folder

Happy MSX-ing!
