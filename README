openMSX Catapult
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the new openMSX Catapult, an external GUI for openMSX.

Requirements:
- Python 3 (probaby 3.5 or higher)
- PyQt5 (thus also Qt5)
- (python-pysqlite2 for softwareDB tool, but that is probably defunct)
- openMSX, just use the latest release

Download links:

Qt5: (pick one of the Open Source Editions)
  https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer
PyQt5: (compilation requires SIP to be installed as well)
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
openMSX:
  http://openmsx.org/

Or you can get openMSX and Catapult from GitHub, that way you will
be able to follow development:
  git clone https://github.com/openMSX/openMSX.git
  git clone https://github.com/openMSX/catapult.git

For the moment, you have to set some hardcoded paths to values
corresponding to your system. You can find these in "custom.py".

Then to start Catapult, just run "make run".

If you have problems like: KeyError: 'system/executable', you're hitting a
small problem in this Catapult that has not been resolved yet. To fix it in
*nix systems, make a file ~/.config/openMSX/Catapult.conf and put in it:
[system]
executable=/path/to/your/openmsx/executable

Win32/MSYS  Section

Sorry, the text below is outdated. Use it as you seem fit, but please submit a
pull request to update it.

I assume you have Python 2.5 and PyQt installed in C:\Python25\  if this is not the case adjust your paths accordingly.

Make sure the python.exe file is accessible through your path (set path in my computer->Advanced->Environment Variables->(go to lower window and add ;C:\Python25 to the path.

- Create a file in your Python root folder called pyuic
- Put the following line into the code:
  /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/uic/pyuic.py ${1+"$@"}
- chmod this file so it's executable from within msys: chmod +x /c/Python25/pyuic
- if you are missing MSVCP71.DLL please download this file from
  http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp71
  and put it in your c:\windows\system32\ folder

Happy MSX-ing!
