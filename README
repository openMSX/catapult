openMSX Catapult
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the new openMSX Catapult, an external GUI for openMSX.

Requirements:
- Python 2.3 or higher
- PyQt4 (thus also Qt4)
- openMSX, preferably a recent version from CVS (post 0.6.1)

For the moment, you have to set some hardcoded paths to values
corresponding to your system. You can find these in "custom.py".

Then to start Catapult, just run "make".
