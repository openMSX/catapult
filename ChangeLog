2006-11-01 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>

2006-10-23 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Added a refresh button to the machine selector.

2006-10-14 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Manuel implemented querying the full machines list from openMSX and
	  populating the machines dialog with that info.
	  I finalized the layout and connected the events.
	  Error handling is still missing though; probably additional support
	  from openMSX is needed to do it well.

2006-09-30 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* First version of machine selection.
	  Not finished yet, but enough to commit.

2006-09-04 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>

	  executable.

2006-09-03 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>

	  TODO: make them changeable :) Defaults are still in custom.py

2006-09-03 Joost Damad <joost@lumatec.be>
	* add support for building a debian package
	* improve clean target: remove .pyc and .pyo files

2006-09-02 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Added "qt_utils" module which gives convenient access to signals and
	  slots (a more Pythonic API).
	* New Make targets:
	  - build: creates generated files ("run" now depends on "build")
	  - clean: removes generated files

	* Implemented basic cassette support.

2006-09-01 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Added support for PyLint:
	  - make sure you have the latest version (www.logilab.org)
	  - the configuration file "pylintrc" is customized for this project
	  - run it on all sources with "make lint", or on one source file with
	    "pylint -rn module.py"

	* Set initial page in mediastack back to the info one.

2006-08-31 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>

	  eventually, but this is at least better than before.

2006-08-29 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>

	* Previous stuff: prototyped by Maarten in 2006
