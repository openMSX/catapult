	* Added support for PyLint:
	  - make sure you have the latest version (www.logilab.org)
	  - the configuration file "pylintrc" is customized for this project
	  - run it on all sources with "make lint", or on one source file with
	    "pylint -rn module.py"

	* Set initial page in mediastack back to the info one.

2006-08-31 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Put all hardcoded paths in "custom.py". They should disappear
	  eventually, but this is at least better than before.

	* Initial ChangeLog
	* Previous stuff: prototyped by Maarten in 2006
